            <h1>We Are The World's Largest University</h1>
            <p>
              With over 40,000 students and staff spanning five university
              sites, EduFord is one of the largest and most influential higher
              education institutions in the country. We are a university that is
              committed to driving forward meaningful change and we have
              received a wide range of prestigious awards for our research,
              dynamism and innovation.
              <br />
              <br />
              We are proud to be recognised as a university that opens its arms
              to all. A quarter of our students come from households with a
              combined income of Â£15,000 or less, and we were the first
              university to sign up to the Government's social mobility pledge,
              demonstrating our commitment to improving the prospects of young
              people from disadvantaged backgrounds.
